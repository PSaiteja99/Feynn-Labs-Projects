# 📊 Fast Food Customer Segmentation using Python

This project replicates the **Fast Food Case Study** from the book *Market Segmentation Analysis* (Dolnicar et al.) using Python instead of R. It performs customer segmentation based on perceptions of McDonald's using **K-Means clustering**, **PCA**, and **visual profiling**.

## 📁 Files Included

- `mcdonalds_segmentation.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with complete segmentation code.
- `mcdonalds.csv` – Dataset containing customer responses (originally used in the R-based case study).

---

## 🧪 Techniques Used

- Data cleaning and transformation
- PCA for perceptual mapping
- K-Means clustering for segment extraction
- Visualization of segment profiles using matplotlib and seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Make sure you have Python installed (recommend using Anaconda or Jupyter Notebook).
3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
4. Run `mcdonalds_segmentation.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
5. Analyze the PCA plots and cluster profiles to understand customer segments.
